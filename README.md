## Robotic Arm Simulation with Image Based Location Detection

This project features a custom-designed robotic arm simulated in the **MuJoCo physics engine**, with a fully self-implemented inverse kinematics algorithm using Python.

---

### 🛠️ Key Components

- 🧩 The arm's **STL parts** were sourced online and assembled in **FreeCAD**.  
- 📦 The merged model was exported and adapted into **MuJoCo's XML** format.  
- 🧠 A **custom inverse kinematics solver** was written in Python (no external IK libraries used), allowing the arm to reach any target **position (XYZ)** and **orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)**.

---

### 🧭 Scene Interaction & Object Localization

- 🎥 The environment contains an object detected using MuJoCo's **built-in camera**.  
- 📐 A **homography-based method** was used to estimate the object's position on the 2D image plane and convert it to **3D world coordinates**.  
- 📏 These coordinates were scaled according to the robot arm’s unit system and passed to the control pipeline.

---

### 🤖 Intelligent Positioning

- A **base-search approach** is used to find the first valid base rotation (omega) that allows the robot arm to reach the target.  
- The robot moves its end-effector to the desired world position and orientation based on the custom IK computation.

### 🧩 Workflow Overview

Below is the step-by-step flow of the system from initialization to continuous loop execution:

1. ✅ **Application is started**, and the GUI window is launched.
2. 🖥️ **MuJoCo Viewer** is initialized and displays the simulation.
3. 🎯 **Camera calibration** is performed using known reference points.
4. 🔁 **Main loop begins**:
   - 🎥 The camera detects the target object in the scene.
   - 📍 The object's world coordinates are estimated via **homography**.
   - 📡 These coordinates are converted to robot units and sent to the robotic arm.
   - 🤖 The robot arm **opens the gripper**, moves to the object's location, and **closes the gripper**.
   - 🎯 It then moves toward the **predefined target drop position**.
   - 📦 Once the position is reached, the gripper **opens** and drops the object.
   - 🔄 The robotic arm returns to its **base position**.
5. 🔁 The loop continues for the next detected object.
